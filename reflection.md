Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

overloaded methods:

- House constructor
    - Made a version that doesn't require a boolean for hasElevator, defaults to no

- House moveIn() and moveOut()
    - Now take list of students and moves them all in/out at once

- Library addTitle() and checkOut()
    - Allows multiple books to be added/checked out at once

- Cafe sellCoffee()
    - Added a default that requires no parameters and sells 12oz w/ one cream and one sugar, and one that allows you to specify only the size (same default additions) 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment was relatively straightforward, we went through everything fairly explicitly during class which was very helpful. I'd recommend working in sections and checking the rubric/readMe as you go.
